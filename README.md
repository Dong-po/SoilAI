# SoilAI
This project aims to promote the development of soil science through the use of algorithms and computing techniques. 
Hopefully one day artificial intelligence can be used to solve problems in soil science. 
The technology that may be used in the project is cloud computing, big data and deep learning. Programming languages involved may include fortran, matlab, C, php, java, scala, python, R. For each specific issue, I will try to choose the most suitable (efficient) programming language.
